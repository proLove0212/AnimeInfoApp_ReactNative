# AnimeInfoApp_ReactNative
# Description:  
This app will provide the user information about Anime (Japanese Cartoon) and Manga (Japanese Comics).  
I used API for information. There are two main Scene Option one is for Anime other one is for Manga.  
  
On the Anime screen, there is a Search option Where the user can search any Anime and it will provide the result according to the search. There is the Top Anime part where at default there will be a top 50 results but users can see more by tapping on Arrow key. Every time tapping on the arrow key will add more 50 results with previous results. And their Upcoming part. There will be a list of Summer, Winter, and Fall upcoming anime. By tapping on any specific anime name or picture it will take to the Details screen. There will be all info about that anime and Genres part. By tapping on any genres name it will take to the screen where it will show the list related to that genre. The manga part is the same as the above Anime part.
